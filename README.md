# To_Do_List_Browser_Extension_Using_GPT4
This repository contains the code of a Simple To Do List Extension which I Created using Chat GPT.

Now, to integrate the extension into your Chrome browser:
Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder containing your extension files (manifest.json, index.html, styles.css, script.js, and icon.png).
The extension should now appear in your list of extensions, and you can access it by clicking the extension icon in the top right corner of your browser.
